<p>The map will load with a facet filter for Call Number. If you would like to facet by this dimension, select the call number(s) you desire. You may also click on the “Facet” button to create your own facet filters on other dimensions in the dataset (Collection City, Collection decade, Composer, Composer Nationality, Owner, Publication City, Publication Country, Publication State, Publisher, Subject, or Title.)</p>
